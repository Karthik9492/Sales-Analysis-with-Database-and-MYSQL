# Sales & Product Analysis with Database and SQL
This project is focused on analyzing a sales dataset using MySQL. The dataset includes tables for Sales, Customers, Products, and Stores. The goal of this project is to explore, analyze, and visualize sales performance, customer behavior, and store operations. I have created a series of SQL queries at various difficulty levels to gain insights and answer business-related questions.
# Key Features
